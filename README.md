# AES-on-microbit

This repository demonstrates end to end encryption using AES and lightweight AES libraries.

This code is design to run on the microbit 2.0 boards using CODAL


To run this code, please build the sender and receiver code one at a time using the main.cpp which should be copied to the sources folder in the microbit_v2_samples folder.
